\# 🚗 Vehicles Data Analysis – Streamlit Web App



\## 📌 Project Overview



This project is an interactive web application developed with \*\*Streamlit\*\* that analyzes vehicle sales listings data.  

The goal is to explore how vehicle mileage relates to pricing and to provide visual insights through intuitive charts.



This project demonstrates my ability to:

\- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

\- Build interactive data applications

\- Communicate insights visually for non-technical users
